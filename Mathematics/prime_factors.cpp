/**
 * Optimised prime factors solution
 * 
 * Here, if the n â‰¤ 1 => There are no prime factors => return;
 * Divisibility by 2 & 3 is considered for optimizing,
 * as it reduces the work done by 3 times.
 * 
 * For example, given numbers
 * 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
 * 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
 * 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, ...n^0.5 (i.e. till sq. root of n).
 * 
 * Now, divisibility of 2 is checked
 * => 3, 5, 7, 9,
 * 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,
 * 21, 23, 25, 27, ...n^0.5 (i.e. till sq. root of n).
 * => Almost half of the numbers are eliminated.
 * 
 * Now, after considering divisibility of 3,
 * => 5, 7,
 * 11, 13, 17, 19,
 * 23, 25, ...n^0.5 (i.e. till sq. root of n).
 * => Almost quarter of the numbers are eliminated.
 * 
 * Now, the pattern can be seen as,
 * i = 5  & (i+2) = 7,
 * i = i + 6 => 11, & (i+2) = 13,
 * i = i + 6 => 17, & (i+2) = 19, ...
 * 
 * Therefore, the for loop will start from int i = 5,
 * & will be incremented by 6 => i += 6
 * 
 * Time complexity in the worst case is that it is a prime factor
 * = O(n^0.5)
